# Homepage
My very own personal website. Basically this is just a **_résumé_**.

Initially, this repository was created for educational purposes for selection to the [**Binary Studio Academy**](https://github.com/BinaryStudioAcademy "Academy's repository"). It hosted with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) at [annabellflem.github.io/homepage](https://annabellflem.github.io/homepage/).

The page uses this scpesial [*stylesheet*](https://github.com/volodymyr-kushnir/volodymyrkushnir.com/tree/master/assets/stylesheets) created by [*Volodymyr Kushnir*](https://github.com/volodymyr-kushnir) for easily and quickly achieve a beautiful resume.
Also I modified the page to make it look more personal and awesome :fire:.
